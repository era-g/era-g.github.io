## First Word Problems #1 - Fingerprints in 14 days, mate!

I recently applied for an Australian tourist visa. If you're ever lodged [on the visa types on the Department of Home Affairs' list](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/biometrics#content-index-7) or you're doing so from [selected countries](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/meeting-our-requirements/biometrics#content-index-8), you might have done the 15 minutes in the fingerprint booth, too.

Welcome, fellow traveler.

As someone borne subject to visa applications, even for simple travel, I almost always expect the process to be dehumanising, frustrating, and time-consuming. In some ways I'm pleased with the Australian process — no less stressful, yes, but next to other internial bureacracies it doesn't fare too bad. Only one thing bothered me: **the request letter**.

Sure it's nice. Looks authoritative and professional. But it's also ambiguous in some ways and hard to scan. It's almost an invitation to miss an vital detail that could make or break your application.

Not shown on the image is the upper fold of the page, which has the applicant's information and reference number. After that, you see the context of the Department's request... including a 14-day deadline that one could so easily overlook.

The next page elaborates on the biometrics collection process. But it's missing the "14 days".

The instructions for the if-scenario of missing the 14-day deadline are ambiguous. There are several forum topics asking about the rules and process of biometrics collection. One could argue that it's a matter of comprehension — BUT if it's not clear enough to be understood by many, then it's not clear at all. That alone merits a fix.

Here's my take: This letter could have better information architecture.
